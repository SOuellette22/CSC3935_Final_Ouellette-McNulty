# Simultaneous Audio Streaming Service

## Description

For this project, we will be using the Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP). We will not use the entire protocol; just a portion, to make it viable to code within the project's time frame.

[RFC2326 Link](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2326#section-10.1)

## Installation

- To set up the project, run the following:
```bash
ant dist
```

- Run the server first as follows:
```bash
java -jar dist/server.jar
```

- Run the client next as follows:
```bash
java -jar dist/client.jar
```

## Usage

This application only allows for .WAV files to be streamed. So here is a converter so you can convert other audio file types to .WAV:

To get some free audio you can go to YouTube studio and download then you will just need to turn them into .WAV files.
